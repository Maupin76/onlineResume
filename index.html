            contexts, underscoring my adaptability and keen business acumen.
            In the realm of technology, I have gained working knowledge in SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau, using these tools for 
            data extraction, reporting, and decision-making. I also have experience in eLearning, having developed and designed 
            learning material for students and staff.
        </p>
        <p>My vast professional experience is complemented by an extensive list of certifications in areas such as data analytics, 
            Lean Six Sigma, and emotional intelligence, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and professional development.
            As I seek new challenges, I intend to bring this diverse skill set and broad experience to a role where strategic 
            thinking, data-driven decision making, and effective team leadership are valued.
